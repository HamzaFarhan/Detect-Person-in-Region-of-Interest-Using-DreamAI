# Detect-Person-in-Region-of-Interest-Using-DreamAI

Using a pre-trained object detection model to detect people in a selected Region of Interest (RoI).

DreamAI is an under development deep learning library written in Pytorch and inspired by FastAI. This notebook is not a tutorial on DreamAI, it is just an example of how its model can be used for some use case. Stay tuned for a detailed overview/tutorial of DreamAI as well as other examples.

You can find the library here: https://github.com/fzaidi2014/dreamai

Any kind of feedback is much appreciated.

We will use our object detection model that we trained using DreamAI in https://github.com/HamzaFarhan/COCO-Object-Detection-using-DreamAI

The user will select an RoI in a video and then a bounding box will be made around any person who enters that region.

# Usage

Download or clone DreamAI from the link provided above.

Download or clone this repository, make sure you set up the paths correctly, and the notebook should run smoothly.
